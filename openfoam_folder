openFOAM HAVE 3 FOLDERS AS FOLLOWS

1)  0                                 field directory , all constants like velocity pressure, temperature is declared
2)  constants                         mesh detaisl, thermalproperties, fluid properties, generally properties folder, also mesh details
3)  system                            details ragarding solution timing, iterations number are specified
4)  postprocessing                    it will be created generally after the simulation is done      
5)  log                               it will have the details of all the iterations

3) system
  i)   controlDict                    in this file we have all the details of simulation time, iterations number 
  ii)  fvSchemes                      The file is responsible for type of flow like steady otr transient, also order of flow like first or second order
  iii) sampling file                  This file is responsible for all the results we will see in paraview for post processing, EVERYTHING SHOULD BE MENTIONED IN this file for example
                                      results at which locations; explain plane cuts 
  iv) decomposeParDict                it has details of number of domains, also method used
  v)  fvSolution                      it as details of the solvers used 
  vi) log                             log file is created after every simulation
  
  
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------THERE ARE MANY SOLVERS IN openFOAM-----------------------------------------------
  
  type "sol" in terminal  and type enter then "ls" it will display all the solvers in openFOAM depending on the project the solver is choosen
  
 TO RUN THE PROJECT , ENTER INTO THE PROJECT FOLDER AND THEN type the name of solver
 
 for example  "rhoSimpleFoam log > $"         it will create log file and also it will run in backend with the command "> $" added in it
               "tail -f log"                  it will take you to backend where simulation is running
